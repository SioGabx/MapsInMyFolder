The complete documentation for this project is available on our [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/SioGabx/MapsInMyFolder/wiki). This documentation details how to use our software.

## Why am I getting warnings from Windows when installing MapsInMyFolder ?
The MapsInMyFolder files are not digitally signed which results in these kinds of warnings. Signing code is expensive, requires a bunch of paperwork. 
If you do not trust the executable on github, you can install the software from the Windows Store. Alternatively, you can always build the code from source.
